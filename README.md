## A Webpage to Display my Deployed Applications

I used basic HTML and CSS to created a responsive website on desktop and mobile to showcase my deployed applications for any job recruiter looking to hire me. 

I learned how to use the grid auto-fit feature in this project as well as got a better grasp of scaling a website down to the mobile platform.
